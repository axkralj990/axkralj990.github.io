<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In this post I will go over some practical concepts on calculating a frequnecy spectrum of a signal and some filtering basics. I will not use too much math, but will provide information on reading material where more math is found for better understanding. I received many questions at work, if I can reffer a good book on filtering EEG signals. While there are many guides on filtering, all of them dive into the details and math much deeper then anyone who was asking for it wanted to go. For this reason I decided to write a tutorial that covers the basics concepts of calculating a frequency spectrum and filtering the signal. If you really want to better understand the subject, which you should if you plan to use this methods extensivelly, I suggest you to start with <a href="http://www.dspguide.com/pdfbook.htm">The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing</a> by Steven W. Smith (free online version). This books covers the basics of DSP in a very readable and enjoyable manner, but it does not use too much math. Once you are familiar with the concepts in Smith's book I suggest you to read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Digital-Signal-Processing-3rd/dp/0137027419">Understanding Digital Signal Processing</a> by Richard G. Lyons or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Time-Signal-Processing-3rd-Prentice-Hall/dp/0131988425/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1524727443&sr=1-4&keywords=alan+oppenheim">Discrete-Time Signal Processing</a> by Alan V. Oppenheim and Ronald W. Schafer. There are also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkvEM5Y3N60">free DSP lectures by Alan V. Oppenheim</a> by MIT OpenCourseWare. There are many other great books and online lectures on DSP, I'm only suggesting these, because they are the ones that I used, feel free to learn from the ones you feel most comfortable with and if you find a really good resource, I would be more than happy if you could email it to me.</div>
