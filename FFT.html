    <h1>FFT</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In this tutorial I will explain the most important concepts that you need to know to calculate the frequency spectrum with an fft algorithm. I will go through two examples, one with MATLAB and another with Python (Numpy and Matplotlib). The purpose of this post is to explain just enough to get the frequency spectrum of a time signal, I will not go deep into theory of the Fourier transform, because there are whole books dedicated to that. I recommend reading <a href="http://www.dspguide.com/pdfbook.htm">The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing</a> by Steven W. Smith (free online version) if you are completely new to signal processing. Anyway, I will briefly mention some of the most basic concepts in the first chapter. Another reason that I am writing this stuff down is for me to read whenever I need to review some concepts, because there are some very important steps when using fft for frequency analysis and I always seem to have trouble remembering every step. If I write them down in a nice tutorial I will have to review more theory to correctly explain the concepts and I will hopefully memorize it better.</p>
