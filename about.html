<p>I work as a researcher in neuroscience at the Mind & Brain Lab at the Department of Psychology, University of Ljubljana. Currently, I am working towards a Ph.D. in Statistics. My Ph.D. research focuses on developing a statistical framework for multimodal (EEG-fMRI) neuroimaging data integration for investigating the role of cortico-subcortical interactions in whole-brain dynamics.</p>

<p>I derive pleasure from mathematics and find inspiration in the nature of our universe, captivated by the hidden elegance of complexity and drawn to the superpowers of our nervous system. I find immense satisfaction in each step towards unraveling the mysteries behind emergent phenomena, from data collection and signal processing to data-driven analyses. When I'm not delving into research, I often conquer steep terrains. At other times, I soar through the skies in light aircraft. The only time I find myself looking down on other people.</p>
