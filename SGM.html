    <h3>Serial Graphing Monitor - Python 2.7</h3>

<p>Serial graphing monitor is used to visualize the data sent via serial communication.
   I use it to analyze the data sent from the MPU6050 IMU connected to Arduino.
    Current code is written for Python 2.7.
     If you want to run it on Python 3 you need to change a couple of things
     (For example: -Py 2: from Queue import Queue -Py 3: from queue import queue). I'm planning to write the program in Python 3.5 whenever I get more time.</p>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to run the code you need to install the following libraries: </p>
<ul>
  <li>PyQtGraph</li>
  <li>PyQt 4.8+ or PySide</li>
  <li>NumPy</li>
  <li>PySerial</li>
</ul>


Place the following files in a folder:

<ul>
  <li>DataMonitor.py</li>
  <li>globals.py</li>
  <li>ComMonitor.py</li>
  <li>SP_logo.png</li>
  <li>COMPORT.png</li>
  <li>BAUDRATE.png</li>
</ul>

<p>To start the program run DataMonitor.py.

  The program is written to receive a maximum of three separate values at a time from serial.
   For now it is programmed in a way that all three values need to be packed in a single line, for example,
    if you want to plot readings from X, Y, and Z accelerometer axis you should write them to serial like this "AccX AccY AccZ\n".
     If only one or two values are written to serial, then only one or two data sets will be plotted.

  Code was inspired by <a href="https://github.com/mba7/SerialPort-RealTime-Data-Plotter"> MBA7's SerialPort-RealTime-Data-Plotter </a> and
  <a href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2009/08/07/a-live-data-monitor-with-python-pyqt-and-pyserial/"> Eli Bendersky work</a>.

  <h3>Serial Graphing Monitor - C# Windows Forms</h3>

  <p>Serial graphing monitor in C# was written after I developed the graphing program in Python.
     I found a desire to improve my knowledge of C# so I used this opportunity
     to write a program I needed. </p>

<p>In order to run the program you need to install
  <a href="http://zedgraph.sourceforge.net/samples.html">ZedGraph</a>.</p>

<p>After I got stable readings from the serial port I also included an option to save the received data to a text file, select the number of reading to store in a buffer for the the data to be plotted, specify an exact received data delimiter and controls for x and y axis ranges. Right now the program works quite stable, the only problem I am encountering is that the graph glitches when I move the window around the screen. I believe that the reason for this is that graph is running on the same thread as the user interface (UI). I am not sure how exactly to solve this problem, so if anyone knows the solution, I would be more than happy to learn it.</p>
